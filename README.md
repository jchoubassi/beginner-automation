# beginner-automation
I am slowly trying to learn automation and it is a big jump in difficulty and layers compared to making some of the small games I have uploaded, but very fun! Again, some of these may be incomplete but for now they sit as part of my documenting my progress and wil be re-uploaded if completed or improved on.

Thanks for checking it out, always open for any tips or ideas :)
